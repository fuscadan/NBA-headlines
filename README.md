# NBA-headlines
Exercise in web scraping and basic machine learning with a project to generate headlines for NBA playoff games.

espn_id_finder - The sports website espn.com assigns a unique ID number to each NBA game in its records.  This program finds those game IDs by visiting the page that lists a given team's schedule on a given year (or range of years) and scrapes the IDs from the hyperlinks to each listed game. The IDs are saved in a text file.

espn_game_summary_scraper - Another exercise in using BeautifulSoup. This program scrapes data from ESPN's game summary page for a given basketball game.
